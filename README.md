# tesla-can-frame-tool

Simple python tool to convert raw Tesla CAN bus frames into a human readable format. The raw CAN bus frames are from TM-Spy. Only a few CAN IDs are currently supported. Created for my personal use but feel free to use it as you see fit.

## Usage
Using python3, run main.py from the terminal and paste in the CAN bus frame when asked.

```
python3 main.py
```
